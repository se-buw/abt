## Organisation of the repository

This repository is intended as the central place for everything source code related. Source code related means all source files, scripts, source code documentation, and testing-related code are collected here, but please EXCLUDE binaries or external pre-compiled dependencies. Please use the [projects moodle-course](https://moodle.uni-weimar.de/course/view.php?id=47422) for meeting-related documents like notes, presentations, or paper collections.

If you need to work on the same code simultaneously, feel free to create branches so that your changes do not interfere with the ones made by the other project members. But please also merge them when you finish your work or if they are not needed anymore.

The repository is subdivided into several folders. A brief explanation of the sub-folders'  function can be found in the respective sub-folder. Please use the folders accordingly.

### Branches
- `main`: This is the main branch of the repository. It is intended to be used for the final version of the project. It should be stable and ready to use at any time.

### Instruction for tasks submission
- To submit your weekly work, you need to commit your work and create a tag for it. The tag should be named as `w-<week number>-<your name>`. For example, if I am submitting my work for week 1, the tag should be named as `w-1-soaib`. Please remember to commit your work before creating the tag. Otherwise, the tag will not contain your work. Please refer to the following link for more information on how to create a tag- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging
- After creating the tag, you need to push it to the remote repository. You can do it by running the following command: `git push origin <tag name>`. For example, if I am submitting my work for week 1, the command should be `git push origin w-1-soaib`. 
- After pushing the tag, copy the tag link and submit it in the [moodle](https://moodle.uni-weimar.de/course/view.php?id=47422) corrosponding to the weekly task. You can copy the tag link by clicking on the tag name in the repository and then copying the link from the browser.
